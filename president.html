      <p>Hello! I am Snek and I want to be the next president of the United States of America! I believe that I would be a good president because of the negative history humans have at fulfilling the job. When humans become president, the economy suffers, we have war, people suffer and die, and as a country, our image is impacted negatively. It is time for a change! I would like to be America's first snake president fo prove that snakes are a more loving and caring creature than humans, and can drive America to a new golden age! Help make America better for future generations! Vote Snek for President 2020!</p>
      <p>Snek is currently eligible as a write-in candidate in the following states: Oregon, Alabama, Iowa, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Washington D.C., Wyoming, and Vermont.</p>
      <p>We are working very hard to get Snek eligible as a write-in or on the ballot for other states!</p>
